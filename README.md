## Getting Help

The code in TeamCode was written by FTC team RoBovines 6955, if you have trouble using Stampede please contact us at team@robovines.org or create a GitHub issue.

## What is Stampede?

Stampede is a pathfinding algorithm that allows robots to drive to target positions and orientations on the field. With Stampede you can make and tune an autonomous much faster and the calibration process is much simpler. It is compatible with wheel encoders, odometry pods (three), and the optical tracking odometry sensor (otos). If you decide to add AprilTags, the robot can correct off them while in motion (unlike RoadRunner).

## Steering Aid
In Tele_Op we added code to help the robot maintain it's heading if the driver hasn't told the robot to turn. This helps the robot drive straight and prevent it from drifting to the side. This code helps the robot drive as straight as possible for the forward and strafe calibration tests.

## How to Use Stampede

To implement Stampede into your code you can either fork this repository or copy the AutoExample, Tele_Op, AngleTrackerIMU, DriveTo, and Stampede files into your code. These files are all in the [TeamCode area](tree/stampede/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode). 

If you have OnBot Java, change your branch to stampede-onbot-java and copy the files from there instead.

Stampede uses the FTC field coordinate system. Each position that you define is going to be where the center of the robot is on the field (x,y) and where the robot is facing (heading). For example, if the robot is on the field's origin facing the red alliance station, the position would be (0, 0, -90).

### Customize AngleTrackerIMU
Change the REV hub orientation to match the orientation of your control hub on the robot (if using the expansion hub IMU instead for some reason use that orientation). Keep in mind this is relative to the robot. The choices are: `BACKWARD`, `FORWARD`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT`.
```
RevHubOrientationOnRobot.LogoFacingDirection logoDirection = RevHubOrientationOnRobot.LogoFacingDirection.BACKWARD;
RevHubOrientationOnRobot.UsbFacingDirection usbDirection = RevHubOrientationOnRobot.UsbFacingDirection.RIGHT;
```

### Customize Stampede
In the init section of the Stampede file, change the false to true if you are using that hardware. This example is a team that is using the IMU and wheel encoders.
```
// If using wheel encoders pass true, otherwise pass false
initWheelHardware(true);
        // If using odometry pods pass true, otherwise pass false
        if (false) {
            odopodLeft = hwMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "odoleft");
            odopodRight = hwMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "odoright");
            odopodMiddle = hwMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "odomid");
        }
        // If using SparkFun otos pass true, otherwise pass false
        if (false) {
            otos = hwMap.get(SparkFunOTOS.class, "otos");
            ...more code...
        }
        // If using the IMU pass true, otherwise pass false
        if (true) {
            initTracker();
        }
```

### Customize Tele_Op
In Tele_Op the default speed is half speed and the default starting orientation is 180°. You can change these defaults in these lines.
```
double speedfactor = 0.5;
...
stampede.angleTracker.setOrientation(180);
```
Tele_Op Controls:
- **Left joystick forward/backward/left/right** drive/strafe
- **Right joystick left/right** turn
- **Hold left trigger** slow down
- **Hold right trigger** speed up

We use Logitech controllers, you may need to alter the controller-specific code depending on what controllers your team uses.

### Configure the Robot
In your driver hub name the robot's hardware. Here are the default names:
- **Wheels** fl, fr, rl, rr
- **IMU** imu
- **Odometry Pods** odoleft, odomiddle, odoright (with odomiddle being the horizontal pod)
- **OTOS** otos

Run Tele-Op and make sure when pushing the left joystick forward, the robot drives forward, left joystick left, the robot strafes left, and right joystick left, the robot turns left. Don't worry it probably won't do the correct thing first try! Change the wheel direction in `initWheelHardware` in the Stampede file (`FORWARD` or `REVERSE`) for any wheels that are spinning the wrong direction.

### General Calibration
The calibration process is similar for both wheel encoders and odometry pods (if you are using OTOS you can skip to that section), except you are going to change different variables in the Stampede file depending on whether you are using wheel encoders or odometry pods. If there are both on your robot, Stampede will use the odometry pods. 

You are going to be running three different tests for calibration, the forward test, strafe test, and turn test. You should be getting similar values in the tests that you run, discard any outliers and rerun tests if you need to. It's better to run more tests and take the average of them.

**Forward Test:** 

Drive *forward* a known distance (we did 96in) and record wheel encoder positions (use absolute value) or odo pod positions (DON'T use absolute value).

**Strafe Test:** 

Strafe *right* a known distance (we did 96in) and record wheel encoder positions (use absolute value) or odo pod positions (DON'T use absolute value).

**Turn Test:** 

Turn *clockwise* a certain number of rotations (we did 10) and record wheel encoder positions (use absolute value) or odo pod positions (DON'T use absolute value).

### Calibration (Wheel Encoders)
Run the forward test and change `FORWARD_ENCODER_COUNTS_PER_INCH` in Stampede to the values you measured. We ran one test and got 3358, 3439, 3362, and 3416 but yours will be different. Again, we ran 96in and have 4 data points so you may need to change those too if you did something different.
```
FORWARD_ENCODER_COUNTS_PER_INCH = ((3358 + 3439 + 3362 + 3416) / 4.0) / 96.0;
```
Run the strafe test and change `RIGHT_ENCODER_COUNTS_PER_INCH` to the values you measured. We ran one test and got 4109, 4056, 3899, and 3884 but yours will be different. Again, we ran 96in and have 4 data points so you may need to change those too if you did something different.
```
RIGHT_ENCODER_COUNTS_PER_INCH = ((4109 + 4056 + 3899 + 3884) / 4.0) / 96.0;
```
Run the turn test and change `CW_ENCODER_COUNTS_PER_DEGREE` to the values you measured. We ran one test and got 28859, 28843, 28849, and 28840 but yours will be different. Again, we turned 360° 10 times and have 4 data points so you may need to change those too if you did something different.
```
CW_ENCODER_COUNTS_PER_DEGREE = ((28859 + 28843 + 28849 + 28840) / 4.0) / 10.0 / 360;
```

### Calibration (Odometry Pods)
Run the forward test and change `LEFT_ENCODER_FORWARD_VALUE`, `MIDDLE_ENCODER_FORWARD_VALUE`, and `RIGHT_ENCODER_FORWARD_VALUE` to the values you measured. Each variable is the sum of that specific pod's encoder counts from each test. For example our first test we got -31297 (left value), -398 (middle value), and -32007 (right value). We then added the rest of the encoder values from the rest of our tests as we went. `FORWARD_TRAVEL` is the *total* distance the robot drove during the forward tests (we drove 96in 4 times).
```
LEFT_ENCODER_FORWARD_VALUE = -31297 + -31422 + -31945 + -31571;
MIDDLE_ENCODER_FORWARD_VALUE = -398 + -840 + -669 + -686;
RIGHT_ENCODER_FORWARD_VALUE = -32007 + -32042 + -31976 + -31996;
FORWARD_TRAVEL = 96 * 4;
```

Run the strafe test and change `LEFT_ENCODER_STRAFE_VALUE`, `MIDDLE_ENCODER_STRAFE_VALUE`, and `RIGHT_ENCODER_STRAFE_VALUE` to the values you measured. Each variable is the sum of that specific pod's encoder counts from each test. For example our first test we got 727 (left value), -31983 (middle value), and -455 (right value). We then added the rest of the encoder values from the rest of our tests as we went. `STRAFE_TRAVEL` is the *total* distance the robot drove during the strafe tests (we drove 96in 4 times).
```
LEFT_ENCODER_STRAFE_VALUE = 727 + 94 + -187 + 1597;
MIDDLE_ENCODER_STRAFE_VALUE = -31983 + -32027 + -32093 + -31979;
RIGHT_ENCODER_STRAFE_VALUE = -455 + -1147 + -1384 + -204;
STRAFE_TRAVEL = 96 * 4;
```

Run the turn test and change `LEFT_ENCODER_CW_TURN`, `MIDDLE_ENCODER_CW_TURN`, and `RIGHT_ENCODER_CW_TURN` to the values you measured. Each variable is the sum of that specific pod's encoder counts from each test. For example our first test we got 132984 (left value), 74385 (middle value), and -126787 (right value). We then added the rest of the encoder values from the rest of our tests as we went. `CW_TURN_DEGREES` is the *total* rotation (in degrees) the robot turned during the turn tests (we did 10 complete rotations, 4 times).
```
LEFT_ENCODER_CW_TURN = 132984 + 133344 + 138101 + 137789;
MIDDLE_ENCODER_CW_TURN = 74385 + 73464 + 86852 + 86790;
RIGHT_ENCODER_CW_TURN = -126787 + -126350 + -120872 + -121079;
CW_TURN_DEGREES = 3600 + 3600 + 3600 + 3600;
```

### Calibration (OTOS)
Follow the normal calibration for OTOS (directions for calibration tests are commented into `configureOtos` in the Stampede file). But don't change the values in the `configureOtos` method, change them when `configureOtos` is called in in `init`. These were the values we had on our robot for the OTOS `x`, `y`, `heading`, `angularScalar`, and `linearScalar`.
```
configureOtos(-7.125, 0, -90, 3600.0 / (3600.0 + 15.6), 96.0 / 92.6);
```

### Autonomous
By default AutoExample will drive to `"Position 1"`, `"Position 2"`, then end at `"Position 3"`. The robot will not completely stop when it gets to `"Position 2"`. What coordinates those are depends on the start position of the robot.

Generally there are four options for where to place your robot to start in autonomous: red/blue and audience/back. If you are standing in the red alliance station facing the field, the audience side would be to your left and back would be to your right. `isRed` and `isAudience` are booleans that you can either change by pressing dpad on your controller while in `init_loop` or you can change them in the class level variables.

Positions are created with their name, location, and orientation in HashMaps depending on the robot being red/blue and audience/back. For example `"start"` is the coordinates  (x, y, heading) the robot is placed on the field to start autonomous. For example, if the robot is audience side and red, it would start at (-12, -63, 90) then `"Position 1"` would be (-36, -40, 90). You can change the coordinates of `"start"`, but *make sure to keep the name the same*. Any of the other `drivePositions` you can change the coordinates and the name. 
```
drivePositionsAudienceRed.put("start", new double[]{-12, -63, 90});
drivePositionsAudienceBlue.put("start", new double[]{-12, 63, -90});
drivePositionsBackRed.put("start", new double[]{12, -63, 90});
drivePositionsBackBlue.put("start", new double[]{12, 63, -90});

drivePositionsAudienceRed.put("Position 1", new double[]{-36, -40, 90});
drivePositionsAudienceBlue.put("Position 1", new double[]{-36, 40, -90});
drivePositionsBackRed.put("Position 1", new double[]{12, -40, 90});
drivePositionsBackBlue.put("Position 1", new double[]{36, 40, -90});
```

AutoExample features a state machine to "step" between actions in autonomous. This is how the first state is set:
```
String nextState = "actionStart";
```
States start with action then have some descriptor to describe what the robot will do in that state. At the end of *every* state you have to tell it what state to go to next. For example this is `actionStart` and the next state is `actionStep2`. You also have the option to specify a speed other than the default speed (`maxSpeedFactor` in DriveTo) and whether the robot will stop at that position or just drive through it (`stopBetween` is true by default).
```
public void actionStart() {
        driveTo.setTargetPosition(drivePositions.get("Position 1"), .25, false);
        nextState = "actionStep2";
    }
```
When you want to end autonomous, set next state equal to `"actionStop"`.

`isBusy` keeps track of if the robot is ready to move onto the next state. It gets stuck in a state unless it reports that the robot isn't busy anymore. If the robot is driving or waiting it's busy. You can also add other `isBusy` clauses if you want the robot to wait for anything else (e.g., a lift to raise).
```
  Boolean isBusy() {
        if (!driveTo.areWeThereYet) {
            return true;
        }
        if (getRuntime() < wait) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
```

### Other Tuning
If the robot isn't driving smoothly you should consider changing some of the variables in DriveTo. The defaults are just the values that worked for us, but we all have different robots so your values may need to be tuned. 
- **`FULL_SPEED_DISTANCE`** distance from target when robot starts slowing down (in inches)
- **`FULL_SPEED_ANGLE`** angle from the target when the robot starts slowing down (in degrees)
- **`NO_STOP_FULL_SPEED_DISTANCE`** distance from target, when not stopping between actions, that the robot starts slowing down (in inches)
- **`NO_STOP_FULL_SPEED_ANGLE`** angle from target, when not stopping between actions, that the robot starts slowing down (in degrees)
- **`CLOSE_ENOUGH_DISTANCE`** distance from target where the robot is close enough and stops (in inches)
- **`CLOSE_ENOUGH_ANGLE`** angle from target where the robot is close enough and stops (in degrees)
- **`NO_STOP_CLOSE_ENOUGH_DISTANCE`** distance from target where the robot is close enough, when not stopping between targets, and moves on to the next action (in inches)
- **`NO_STOP_CLOSE_ENOUGH_ANGLE`** angle from target where the robot is close enough, when not stopping between targets, and moves on to the next action (in degrees)
- **`TIME_TO_SPEED_UP`** when stopped before starting an action, the time it takes to speed up to maxSpeedFactor (in seconds)
- **`DISTANCE_PID_D`** factor determining how far the speed can stray from the target forward and right speed
- **`ANGLE_PID_D`** factor determining how far the speed can stray from the target turn speed
- **`MAX_STALL_TIME`** maximum amount of time of the robot not moving until the robot gives up on the current action and moves onto the next one (in seconds)
- **`MIN_MOVE_DIST`** minimum travel distance in order to be considered moving (in inches)
- **`MIN_MOVE_ANGLE`** minimum angle change in order to be considering turning (in degrees)
 
For example, this year our robot was much heavier and kept overshooting it's target heading. We increased `FULL_SPEED_ANGLE` to help stop this from happening.
